### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Accessibility
- Practice making Awesome UI elements with HTML, CSS and JS
- Understand more about Semantic HTML


### Useful resources

- [MDN Prefers Color Scheme CSS Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - This helped me understand a little bit more about the prefers color scheme
- [scottaohara Github notes]( https://scottaohara.github.io/a11y_styled_form_controls/src/radio-button--switch/) - I understood more about the proper way to comeup with good html structure of radio buttons. The html structure proposed not only works well it is also functions well for accessibility
- [Accessbility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/) - This is pretty much one of the concepts which i normally ignore, but reading through this website made me understand the importance. So i try my best to focus a little more an Accessibility.
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - Since i currently work a lot with SASS this came in quite handy. I almost always forgot certain aspects, so i checked the documentation to get more info.
